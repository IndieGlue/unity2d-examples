# unity2d-examples

This repository is an archive of example code that we used for our game "The girl who met her shadow".

Initially, our aim was to get rid of Unity's `Rigidbody2D` component completely so that we have more flexibility when creating any actions and collisions. After getting rid of `RigidBody2D` we experienced the power of using transform-based movements and decided to follow the rule to avoid any unity or 3rd party components (E.g. `Cinemachine`) that will compromise flexibility.

When I talk about "flexibility" I mean the power to do anything without requiring any workarounds, because we have become too dependant on Unity forcing us in a direction when it comes to implementation.

## Code examples

All examples listed here does not replicate the architecture of our code base with "The girl who met her shadow", it just gives a simple code example.

## We will contribute to this repository as we get time between our full-time jobs and developing the game
