# Path Finding

In order to build effective and interesting AI, we need to start by building a strong foundation. In comes Path Finding. 
This is a take on implementing a way for AI to navigate, over obstacles, in the most efficient way in order to reach an end goal.

Normally in 2d games, whether it be top down or a platformer style game, path finding works within a grid-based system. This system can get quite complex as in each grid item you need to identify what the AI needs to do.
This gets even more complicated when the end and start goals are constantly changing, for instance, a moving player.
